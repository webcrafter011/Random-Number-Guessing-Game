# Random Number Guessing Game

A fun Python-based guessing game where players try to guess a randomly generated number within a given range. ðŸŽ²

## How It Works

1. The user enters their name and is greeted with a brief introduction.
2. The user specifies the lower and upper limits of the random number range.
3. A random number is generated within the given range.
4. The user has 7 attempts to guess the number, with hints provided for each incorrect guess:
   - "Too high" if the guess is above the number.
   - "Too low" if the guess is below the number.
5. The game ends when the number is guessed or the user runs out of attempts.

## Features

- **Customizable Range**: Users choose the range of numbers for the game.
- **Input Validation**: Handles invalid inputs gracefully.
- **Friendly Hints**: Guides the user with feedback for incorrect guesses.
