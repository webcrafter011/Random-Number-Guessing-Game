# Press Enter Game

A simple Python program that waits for the user to press the Enter key before continuing.

## How It Works

This program demonstrates how to use the `input()` function to wait for the user to press the Enter key. It can be expanded into a more interactive game or serve as a building block for other Python projects.

## Code Example

```python
print("Press Enter to continue...")
input()
print("You pressed Enter!")
```

## Features

- **Simple and Interactive**: Just run the program and press Enter when prompted.
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Great for those learning Python basics.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Copy the code above into a file named `press_enter.py`.
3. Run the program using the command:
   ```bash
   python press_enter.py
   ```
4. Follow the instructions displayed on the screen.

## Customization

Feel free to modify the program to add more interactivity or logic. For example, you could:
- Add a countdown timer before accepting the Enter key.
- Count how many times the user presses Enter.
